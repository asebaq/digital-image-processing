# Digital image processing using MATLAB
In this repo I've some basic image processing scripts and some projects which are implemented using **MATLAB**.

## Projects

- [x] Video processing GUI app.
  - Read a video file and segment each frame.
  - Apply some digital filters as: madian, average, gaussian, laplacian, and unsharpening.
- [x] Image processing GUI app.
  - Apply some digital filters as: median, average, Sobel, Robert, Gaussian, and Laplace. 
  - Apply transformations as: log, power, negative, and Piecewise-Linear.    
  - Do line detection like: 1st and 2nd derivative, canny, and houghtransform.
  - Do Histogram equalization.                
- [x] Face recognition.
  - Preprocess the faces images.
  - Use PCA to get faces eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
  - Do face classification using Euclidean distance.
- [x] OCR GUI app.
  - Read a page and preprocessing it.
  - Extract lines, words, and letters.
- [x] Sinogram reconstruction for radiology images.
  - Use inverse Radon transform to do image reconstruction.

## Simple scripts

- [x] Image binarization
- [x] Image bit slicing.
- [x] Diabetic data analysis.
- [x] Edge detection with sobel operator.
- [x] Image Gray-scale converter.
- [x] Image Histogram equalization.
- [x] Image Histogram.
- [x] Image Gray-scale slicing.
